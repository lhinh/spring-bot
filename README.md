# Discord Spring Boot Bot

This project is a simple Discord bot using Spring Boot using Discord4J and is primarily a private-use bot while exploring Discord APIs. The motivation of this bot is to stream music into a single server, and will eventually be improved to handle multiple servers. More features will be documented here as I discover them.

## To do

* Music streaming to separate guilds
* Message pin to separate channel (circumvent 50 pin limit per channel)
* APIs for external bot control
